# Arbetsportalen - a version of Platsbanken

## üìÑ About The Project

**During the course "Javascript f√∂rdjupning" at Medieinstitutet, we were tasked with developing a webpage that allows users to search for job ads using Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen's API and Designsystem. The project was built using React and TypeScript, with a focus on enhancing skills in API integration, frontend development, and responsive design. We worked on creating a user-friendly interface that supports efficient job searches and provides detailed information on each position, directly sourced from Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen's database. Through this project, we gained hands-on experience with modern development tools and best practices in web application development.**
